Ingredient pickup would be much simpler if DECORATE supported sending string arguments to ACS,
if there were event catch/hooks for pickup state

Ammo/Wep/XWToken are managed via ACS for mods' weapons, because Zandro throws "unknown class" 
warnings if you mention non-defined actor in DECORATE (i.e in case Xover is hosted without the mods)
