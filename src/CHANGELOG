<<< GENERAL >>>	
	> Recipe Mix's randomly given recipe doesn't favor anymore the leftmost 
		weapon ingredients on the current map weapon list. It truely is random now
	> Corrected "Power up! [Weapon name]" message and Xover Weapon bar colors 
		sometimes being displayed erroneously online
	> Recipe Mix bags shouldn't unsync online anymore
	> Ammo and screws now don't respawn if sv_itemrespawn is disabled
	> Xover Weapons now won't consume ammo if sv_infiniteammo is enabled
	> Fixed an issue where the registered fusions weren't cleared, diverging
		from the player's actually owned fusions
	> The screen properly clears Xover Weapons ammo bars and the crafting table
		when joining the dead spectators in game modes like (T)LMS or Survival
	> Xover Weapons' tag name's color doesn't affect the text coming after anymore
	> Screws dropped by players now properly eventually vanish
	> Fixed the generic animated bar's animation
	> Vanilla weapons stay on map when picked up, rather than respawning 
		half a second later
	
<<< WEAPONS >>>
	> Glue Shot
		- Block shouldn't get players stuck inside anymore
		- Block sprite displays properly if voxels are turned off
		- Voxel lateral offset properly centered
	> Ground Dash
		- Fixed other players seeing a charged attack boulder's health by damaging it

	> Hellfire Cutter
		- Can't mark non-players anymore

<<< KNOWN BUGS >>>
	> If Xover Weapons are kept between PvM maps, a player dieing on map start
		(likely due to telefrag because of the map not having enough spawn spots)
		might glitch their weapon inventory. Enabling sv_unblockallies prevents 
		this issue, but it's the mappers' job to have sufficient spawn spots

				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Version 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				~~~~~~~~~~~ 09/07/2021 (MM8BDM-v6a) ~~~~~~~~~~~~
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				
	> Major update. Mod completely rebuilt and redesigned from zero.
		The only leftover from the previous versions is the mod's name.
		This is rather a stable engine/pre-beta build than an actual,
		finished mod release

			"Haha nope I didn't added Mega Man 2 yet. Creating 28 weapons takes time!"

> The weapons instantly respawn after being picked up, even the rare weapons like Time Slow!
> Actions with the wrench key are more dynamic, executed faster
> The way the weapons which aren't of the selected episode are converted was changed. Each non-MM1
weapon now morphes randomly into a weapon from a list of weapons (for instance ; Search Snake
can either turns into a Fire Storm, a Thunder Beam or a Ice Slasher, instead of turning into a 
Fire Storm with 100% of chance, like in v1a.)
Additionally, the 4 MMK killers weapons aren't converted, and the same goes for Mega Ball, they're
unique

> Guts x Time slight damage buff. The weapon correctly falls and play the chime sound online!
> Continual earthquake when you sometimes finish using Bomb x Elec is fixed
> Fire rate of Fire x Oil (for the oil machinegun) reduced by 1 tic. Damage of the blobs lightly
increased (6 ==> 8)

> Fire x Ice fire rate slightly buffed, and obit references the weapon's name
> Cut x Guts damager damage reduced (13 ==> 11)
> Cut x Time's knives damage : 1 ripping ==> 3 ripping
> Bomb x Elec range and damage nerf
> Ice x Time (Glacial Spell) damage buff (A_Explode 10 => 15)
> Elec x Oil obit changed ; hitstun removed
> Cut x Fire's slight damage nerf
> Guts x Bomb damage increased
> Cut x Ice damage reduced by 1 ripping
> Bomb x Oil ammo receiving on pickup increased ; radius damage reduced
> Goodbye Eddie (he's evil >.>) ! Hello Reggae! He can steal crossover weapons, yup
> A few Secret Recipes were introduced
